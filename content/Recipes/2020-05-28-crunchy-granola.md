# Crunchy Granola
May 28, 2020

## This is an adapted version of this [recipe](https://www.cookingclassy.com/granola-without-oil/#wprm-recipe-container-30209) by Cooking Classy. I generally make a massive amount of granola every two weeks and eat it for breakfast daily with soy milk. 

## Ingredients 

- 8 cups oats, not quick cooking oats
- 1 cup pumpkin seeds
- 1 cup sunflower seeds
- 1/2- 3/4 cup brown sugar (sometimes with honey, agave, or maple syrup)
- 2 Tbsp water
- 2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp nutmeg
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/4 tsp baking soda

#### add-ins when out of oven
- 1 cup raisins or craisns 
- 1/2 cup toasted coconut flakes (baking with this mixed in did not come out super well)


## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Mix oats and nuts together. Leave out dried fruit until after it's out of the oven.

2. In a medium saucepan, combine brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt. Stir frequently until it comes to a boil, and boil for 1 minute.  

3. Take off heat, stir in vanilla and baking soda. Whisk until mixture gets foamy. Pour over oats immediately and toss to cover (really just mix real well). 

4. Spread oats onto baking sheet (usually I need two for this recipe) with parchment paper underneath. 

5. Bake in preheated oven, about 15-30 minutes until lightly golden brown, removing from oven and tossing during baking.

6. Once finished, take out of oven and allow to cool before storing in a container.
