# Quinoa Black Bean Burgers
May 28, 2020

## This is an adapted version of this [recipe](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/220661/quinoa-black-bean-burgers/). I doubled the recipe and made some adjustments to use my own cooked beans. 
## Ingredients
- 2 cups cooked black beans (rinsed and drained)
- 1 cup cooked quinoa
- 1 cup bread crumbs (I used plain gluten free)
- 4 tablespoons minced onion
- 1 large clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder 
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoon hot sauce
- 1 egg
- 3 tablespoons canola oil

## Directions
1.  (skip if quinoa is already cooked) Bring the quinoa and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the quinoa is tender and the water has been absorbed, about 15 to 20 minutes. 
2. Roughly mash the black beans with a fork leaving some whole black beans in a paste-like mixture. 
3. Mix the quinoa, bread crumbs, onion, garlic, cumin, salt, hot sauce, and egg into the black beans using your hands. 
4. Form the black bean mixture into patties. If the patties do not form, can try adding more black beans, bread crumbs, or another egg depending on the consistency. 
5. Heat the oil in a large skillet. 
6. Cook the patties in the hot oil until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes per side
7. Add siracha mayo sauce and enjoy!
