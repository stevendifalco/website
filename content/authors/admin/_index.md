I am currently pursuing a master’s degree in Natural Resources at the University of Connecticut, where I am studying the human dimensions of roadside vegetation management. My research project involved a survey mailed to residents of Connecticut, to understand public perceptions and opinons towards roadside tree management. I used spatial analysis to evaluate how attitudes vary spatially. While at UConn, I have honed my skills in ArcGIS/ArcOnline and developed an understanding of statistical softwares such as R, Python, and SPSS.

Before starting my master's, I worked in invasive plant management and native habitat restoration for five years, holding positions at city, state, and non-profit organizations in New York. 

I received my bachelor’s degree from the State University of New York at New Paltz in Biology. During my time at SUNY New Paltz, I studied spatial temporal variability of water quality in an anthropogenically affected river and the effects of soil characteristics on invasive plant success.
