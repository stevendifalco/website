### I have been helping with Joshua's Trust and the Town of Mansfield to develop an application in ArcGIS Online for local trail information. Pulling together town, state, and land trust trail to one place and provide useful information for those who would like to recreate in the Mansfield, CT. This project is still in progress, but an example of the trail mapper can be found below.
